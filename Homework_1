<h1>Taras Shevchenko</h1>
<p>Artist, poet, national bard of Ukraine, Taras Shevchenko was born on 9 March,
1814 in Moryntsi, Kiev gubernia. He was born a serf. When he was a teenager
he became an orphan, and grew up in poverty. When he was 14, his owner,
Engelhardt took him to serve as a houseboy. And Taras travelled with him
to Vilnus and to St Petersburg. In Vilnus Taras for the first time heard 
different languages, Lithuanian, Russian and Polish and there he
saw people whom their masters made free. When Engelhardt noticed
the boy’s skiils in painting he apprenticed him to the painter 
Shiriayev for four years.</p>

<p>At that time the young man met his compatriots Zoshchenko, Hrebinka, 
Hryhorovych, and Venetsianov, they showed his works to the famous Russian
artist Karl Bryullov. Shevchenko’s paintings impressed Bryullov,
and he decided to help him. Karl Bryullov painted a portrait of
the Russian poet Zhukovsky and disposed it in a lottery. 
The money was used to buy Shevchenko’s freedom from Engelhardt in 1838.</p>

<p>Shevchenko entered the Academy of Fine Arts in St Petersburg,
there he became a student of Bryullov. Shevchenko was awarded 
three silver medals for his works and later he had become an
Academician in engraving.</p>

<p>Studying at the Academy T. Shevchenko understood that his main
calling, his true passion was poetry. In 1840 he published his
first collection of poems “Kobzar”. In 1841 followed the epic
poem “Haidamaky”, in 1844 the ballad “Hamalia”.</p>

<p>When he graduated from the Academy, he became a member of the Kiev Archeographic 
Commission. In 1846 in Kiev he entered the secret Cyril and
Methodius Brotherhood. It was a secret political society, in
1847 it was smashed, and Shevchenko was arrested and sent to
the Orenburg special corps, he was deprived the right to draw 
and write. 10 years of exile ruined his health, and Shevchenko became seriously ill.</p>

<p>When he was released in 1857 it was forbidden to him to live in Ukraine. 
He moved to St Petersburg but on March 10, 1861 the great poet died of
heart disease. He was buried in St Petersburg, but his friends wanted
to fulfill the poet’s wish that he had expressed in his “Testament” 
and they transferred his remains to the Chernecha Hill near Kanev, in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Shevchenko’s works take an important place in Ukrainian literature and history. 
His literary output consists of the collection of poetry <i>“Kobzar”,</i>
the drama <i>“Nazar Stodolia”</i>; two dramatic fragments; nine novelettes, 
a diary, and a autobiography in Russian; and over 250 letters.</p>

<p>Shevchenko was an outstanding poet and a highly accomplished artist.
There are 835 works written by him, although 270 are known to have been lost.
His collection also contains over 150 portraits, 42 self-portraits.
There are many landscapes, watercolours and etchings.</p>

<h2>The Testament</h2>
<p>Dig my grave and raise my barrow<br>
By the Dnieper-side<br>
In Ukraina, my own land,<br>
A fair land and wide.<br>
I will lie and watch the cornfields,<br>
Listen through the years<br>
To the river voices roaring,<br>
Roaring in my ears.</p><br>

<p>When I hear the call<br>
Of the racing flood,<br>
Loud with hated blood,<br>
I will leave them all,<br>
Fields and hills; and force my way<br>
Right up to the Throne<br>
Where God sits alone;<br>
Clasp His feet and pray…<br>
But till that day<br>
What is God to me?</p><br>

<p>Bury me, be done with me,<br>
Rise and break your chain,<br>
Water your new liberty<br>
With blood for rain.<br>
Then, in the mighty family<br>
Of all men that are free,<br>
May be sometimes, very softly<br>
You will speak of me?</p></center>

<h3>Kiev</h3>
<p>Kiev (or Kyiv) is the capital and the largest city of Ukraine, located in the north central
part of the country on the Dnieper River. The name Kiev is derived from the name of Kiy, one 
of four legendary founders of the city.</p>

<p>By the ancient legend Kiev was founded by three brothers Kiy, Schek, Khoriv and their sister Lybid.
They were surprised by the beauty of Dnieper’s hills, stopped to settle here and called 
the town in honour of the eldest brother-Kiev. A monument to the founders was erected at the
Dnieper embankment in our days. The town’s place was chosen succesfully,
the high Dnieper’s slopes were perfect protection against the raids of nomad tribes.</p>

<p>Kiev stretches for the space of more than 20 km along the picturesque banks of the 
biggest Ukrainian river — Dnieper. Its square consists 827 sq.km.
The population of Kiev is about 3 millions people.</p>

<p>Kiev is one of the oldest Slavic centres, <strong>“Mother of Russian touns”</strong> so it was called in olden times,
its age is more than 1500 years. The first settlements on the territory of modern
Kiev appeared from 15000 till 20000 year ago.</p>

<p>During the time of Vladimir the Great (980-1015) government 
our city begins to develop especially rapidly. In order to consolidate Kiev Russ and to increase 
its international influence the prince Vladimir baptised the Russ in 988. 
Christianity and became that impulse for further development of written language and culture.</p>

<p>Today Kiev is an important industrial, scientific, educational 
and cultural centre of Eastern Europe. It is home to many high-tech industries,
higher education institutions and world-famous historical landmarks.
The city has an extensive infrastructure and highly developed system of public transport, including the Kiev Metro.</p>

<h3>The climate of Ukraine.</h3>
<p>The climate of Ukraine is determined by its geographical location.
Ukraine’s territory lies in the temperate belt and its climate is temperately continental,
only the southern coast of the Crimea is subtropical. 
The climate of Ukraine is characterized by considerable variations
due to the great range from north to south and from west to east, 
stretching from the areas under the influence of the north-western
Atlantic to the interior of the continent. This means that the air
temperature decreases not only from north to south but also from
west to east. The characteristic features of the climate are
higher summer temperatures, lower winter temperatures, and rare rainfalls.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian climate has considerable fluctuation in weather 
conditions from year to year. Alongside very wet years there
can be droughts, and alongside cold years there are warm years.</p>

<p>The Black and the Azov seas have small influence on the 
climate and it’s felt only in coastal areas. The warmest
region is nearby the Black Sea, the coldest — in the north-east 
and in the mountains. The southern coast of Crimea is subtropical. 
Crimean mountains obstruct the movement of cold Arctic air to the
coast and create conditions for one of the best resort areas in Ukraine.</p>

<p><strong>The average yearly temperature in Ukraine varies between +5..+7 C in 
the north and +11..+13 C in the south. January is the coldest month and July
is the hottest one.</strong></p>

<p>In general Ukraine can be divided into four different climatic
regions: cool snow forest climate, steppe climate, Mediterranean 
climate and mountain tundra climate.</p>
