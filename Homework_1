<h1>The Testament</h1>
<p>Dig my grave and raise my barrow<br>
By the Dnieper-side<br>
In Ukraina, my own land,<br>
A fair land and wide.<br>
I will lie and watch the cornfields,<br>
Listen through the years<br>
To the river voices roaring,<br>
Roaring in my ears.</p><br>

<p>When I hear the call<br>
Of the racing flood,<br>
Loud with hated blood,<br>
I will leave them all,<br>
Fields and hills; and force my way<br>
Right up to the Throne<br>
Where God sits alone;<br>
Clasp His feet and prayâ€¦<br>
But till that day<br>
What is God to me?</p><br>

<p>Bury me, be done with me,<br>
Rise and break your chain,<br>
Water your new liberty<br>
With blood for rain.<br>
Then, in the mighty family<br>
Of all men that are free,<br>
May be sometimes, very softly<br>
You will speak of me?</p></center>
